Instagram for iPad
------
My take of an Instagram Application for iPad built using Titanium Appcelerator. It is not completely developed and it has a few bugs, but you can take it for a spin with a simple setup in `alloy.js` file.

Usage

Remember to change these values (`alloy.js`) with your own credentials from [Instagram](http://instagram.com/developer/)

```js
// Instagram global values
Alloy.Globals.instagram = {
	clientId: "your-instagram-client-id",
	clientSecret: "your-instagram-client-secret",
	urlCallback: "your-instagram-URL-callback"
};
```
